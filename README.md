# eYRC25-26 Krishi Drone Theme

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this challenge is to navigate a nano drone through a smart greenhouse, guided by real-time vision from an overhead camera, detect infested plants and performs precise, targeted pesticide pickup and application to affected crop areas.

## Implementation:
The challenge will be divided into two phases:
- Simulation: Participants will use the Gazebo simulator to fly the drone and perform a preliminary run of the challenge.

- Hardware: Those who successfully complete the simulation phase may advance to the second stage, where they will receive hardware to replicate their simulation work in a real-world environment.
